# Teaches the 100 most common radicals

This is a web app which teaches the pronunciation and meaning of the most common 100 radicals in Mandarin Chinese. It does this by shuffling correctly answered radicals backwards, exponentially farther each time
you answer correctly.

I (among others) have found that learning radicals makes it much easier to memorize new characters, in the same way it's easier to remember large numbers if you already know about digits (and even moreso, pairs or triplets of digits).

## Radical list is taken from here:
